Hi,

this is my own little fork of the dactyl manuform 4x6 keyboard modified with a joystick.

Special thanks to the qmk developers and the concerned discord community for code and help.

Feel free to ask anything.

layouts containing the example layouts - recommend the final.json
layoutScript combines your layout with the algorithms for the joystick
pictures some example pictures

How does it work?:
